# Classical and Quantum Wave Simulations

A project that numerically models solutions to the 1D time-independent Schrodinger Equation as well as a loaded-string classical system, which behaves like coupled oscillators or "discrete waves".

**See the "Examples" folder for examples of the visualizations and animations generated**

## Methods and Mathematical Formulation

**Please see the "brief" for more detailed discussion on methods and equations used.**
